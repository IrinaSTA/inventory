# QUESTIONS TO MYSELF
#  does "load" load once i.e. do i have to reload?
#  how do I query price history I want to be able to query this
# ***This has to say "if supplier by that name has not been created yet, then create it. Otherwise, use THAT supplier and assign it to this variable"
# What is the right order of listing instance vs (private?) variables?
# What is the best order of laying out class methods and variables?
# What is the right spacing between methods and variables etc?
# How do I install and run that gem that checks your code for best OOD practices?
# How do I more properly run tests? I need to include them in a separate file.

# USER STORIES
# * As a user, When I create a product with a supplier that does not exist
# I want to be able to create that supplier on the fly
# * Otherwise, if that supplier does exist, I want to "associate" it with
# that particular supplier
# Products by that Supplier's name - i.e. those products have to "belong" or
# be associated with that supplier.
# * I also want to track a product's price history - DONE, implemented via hash
# * If I created a supplier and some products to go with it, but misspelled
# the name, I want to be able to easily change the name right there and then.
# If I want to correct the spelling of a product's name after I've created it,
# I want to be able to do that. - DONE
# (How do you implement multiples currencies in a system???)
# (What is the difference between Date.new and Time.new?)
# Note: Because product originally weren't initialized with a price_history,
# When I later change their prices, I get an error, as there is no place to
# store it!
